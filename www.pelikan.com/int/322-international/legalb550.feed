&lt;h2&gt;The Use of Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accordance with art. 6 par. 1 lit. GDPR, it is in our legitimate interest to use the service &quot;Google Analytics&quot;, a web analyzing service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA („Google“)), for the purpose of optimizing and analyzing our website. Google Analytics uses socalled &quot;cookies&quot;, text files that are saved on your computer that analyze how you use the website. The cookies created on your usage of this website are normally transfered to a Google server located in the USA and are saved there. However, in the event that the IP-anonymization on this website has been activated, your IP address will be abbreviated by Google within the EU member states or in other signatories of the European Economic Area. Only under exceptional circumstances will the full IP address first be transmitted to a Google server in the U.S. and then abbreviated. Commissioned by the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to present reports about website activity and to provide additional services to the website operator related to website and internet usage. The IP address transmitted from your browser that is used by Google Analytics, will not be brought together with other Google data.&lt;/p&gt;
